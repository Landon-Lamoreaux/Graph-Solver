# Graph Solver
This program reads in a graph in the DOT language format. It then "Solves" it, meaning, depending on the type of graph it is it will find the shortest path to every node, if there are cycles it will tell you and give you the first cycle, it will tell you the maximum flow through the graph, if its an acyclic graph it will topologically sort the graph, it will find eulers circuits, the minimum spanning tree, and Kruskals minimum spanning tree.
Just give it a text file with the graph in the DOT language format and it will give you information based on the type of graph. Some example graphs are in the folder labeled "Example Graphs".
